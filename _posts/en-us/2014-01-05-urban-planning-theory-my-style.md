Tom Turner wrote a clear [essay on the history of urban planning and design](https://www.gardenvisit.com/history_theory/library_online_ebooks/architecture_city_as_landscape).
The hierarchy of roads over housing over the garden needs reconsidering. The seductive
use of maps and words by politicians and designers may lead one to believe there is a
right and a wrong way of laying out squares and roads. But Turner makes a case for less
binary or-or mono-function and more diffuse categories. Bottom-up initiatives may aid us
as designers. Still, I find the structuring of spaces as put forward by Edmund Bacon an
inspiring method.
