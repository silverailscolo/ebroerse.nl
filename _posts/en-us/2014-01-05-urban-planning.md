Tom Turner wrote a clear essay on the _history of urban planning and design_. The hierarchy of roads over housing over the garden needs reconsidering.
The seductive use of maps and words by politicians and designers may lead one to believe there is a right and a wrong way of laying out squares and roads. But Turner makes a case for less binary or-or monofunction and more diffuse categories.
Bottom-up initiatives may aid us as designers. Still, I find the structuring of spaces as put forward by Edmund Bacon an inspiring method.
