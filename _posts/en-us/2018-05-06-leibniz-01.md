Walking the [Herrenhausen Garten](http://www.herrenhaeuser-gaerten.de) in Hannover we saw large 1's and 0's on a pavilion
near the baroque gardens. Intrigued by these "modern" patterns as a Java developer, I
learned they were painted in 2016 to honour [Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz](http://leibniz-binary.com), the
inventor of the binary system 300 years ago.
