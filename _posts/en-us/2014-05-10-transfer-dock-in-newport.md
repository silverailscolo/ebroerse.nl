A birthday gift: the Micro Trains N civil era transfer dock and barge. Assembled the kit
today as two stalls instead of three to make it special (and fit the available space).
A perfect match for my water level and width. Desperately in need of a couple of short
(27') flat cars, however. Even the coal car can't pass through the gallow.
