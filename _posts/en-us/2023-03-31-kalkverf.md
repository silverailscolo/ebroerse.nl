Today I covered the walls of our main hall in [NF21 Uniwall Primer](https://serefni.is/vara/primer-nf21-kalkgrunnur/), as a base for
two layers of Stoopen & Meeus [Chalk Paint](http://www.stoopen-meeus.com/minerale-afwerkingen/kalk/).

It is always special to put a soloif color over all repairs and old marks: suddenly you experience mass and space instead of a construction site.

The next two days I brushed on the chalk paint, working from a work platform that I borrowed from a naighbor.
It's raining anyway!
