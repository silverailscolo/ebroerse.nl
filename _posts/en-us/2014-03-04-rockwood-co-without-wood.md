The rock cliff at Rockwood has been an item on my to do list for at least one year. So I'm really happy the styrofoam changed into colorful rocks late last night.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/blog/20140304-173323.jpg" title="Rockwood general view" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    View of Rockwood.
</div>

Upon entering the layout room, this is a huge improvement as it dominates the view.
Ballasting, adding trees and shrubs and a few buildings will make the small settlement
into a mini scene halfway up in the Rockies.
