In this book, Wright expounds upon his innovative and groundbreaking ideas about architecture - specifically, that architecture should be organic in nature. Spanning his entire career, including blueprints and sketches for buildings never constructed, In the Realm of Ideas give anyone with even a passing interest in architecture the grounds to understand the architectural revolution that occurred in the early part of the 20th century. Wright was an integral part of that revolution; he stood at the center. In the Realm of Ideas provides his thoughts and reflections on the nature of architecture, something we all should consider in today's world of chrome and glass buildings that jab at the sky and crowd the center of our cities.
