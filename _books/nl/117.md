The principal theme of this `collage' of military scenes during a hot summer camp is fear of living, symbolized by the serpent, which instigates fear.
Stig Dagerman expresses loudly his hatred of the iron chain of the State, the dispenser of security (`this demoralizing order'), his anti-middle class sentiments (`the quiet happiness') and his nausea of the horrible world of the adults (generation conflict). The only solution for him is an epoch of new intellectualism.
At the end of the book, the author unveils the real sense of his literary vocation: destroy all barriers; only those who really understand the fear of living can appraise it.

The different scenes brushed in this book are very uneven, sometimes very hard, sometimes rather static, sometimes superficial. Overall, there is an atmosphere dominated by violent emotions and sexual provocations, but the author's writings don't always sufficiently `bewitch' the reader and convince him that there is a 'real' fear of living.

This book has not the same high standard as `A burnt Child'.
Only for Stig Dagerman fans. Or. title: Ormen
