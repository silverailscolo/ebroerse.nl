title: "Night Trains : The Pullman Systems in the Golden Years of American Rail Travel"
year: 0
---

Forty years ago, it was the way to travel. Back then, one could climb between crisp linens and soft blankets, adjust the oversized pillows, and watch America speed by in the night. With more than 300 photographs and 50 maps, "Night Trains" is a lively account of the Pullman enterprise during the golden years of its operation--from 1920 to 1955--when the remarkable sleeping car system routinely played host to more than 50,000 guests nightly.

"A compelling tribute to a bygone time when getting there was half the fun... An education for the young and a scrapbook for those who remember." " -- Herald-Dispatch"
