It is the year 1327. Franciscans in an Italian abbey are suspected of heresy, but Brother William of Baskervilleâ€™s investigation is suddenly overshadowed by seven bizarre deaths.
Umberto Eco's "The Name of the Rose" is a brilliant mystery set in a fictitious medieval monastery. The text is rich with literary, historical, and theoretical references that make it eminently re-readable. Or. title: Il Noma della Rosa
