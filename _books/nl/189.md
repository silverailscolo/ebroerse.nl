Drawing by hand - states Frits Palmboom - involves a number of essential skills within the domain of urban design, thus serving as an instrument to relate yourself to the dimensions of large sites and major assignments, to exercise and understand complexity, to get a grip on the operations of time and to learn how to deal with uncertainty. Given the sensitivity of the matter, far removed from the verbal language, though necessarily convergent, the sketches of Frits Palmboom, chosen from the entire body of his work of personal hand drawings, published here for the first time, introduce to some very important and different issues. Drawing landscapes to understand the deeply rooted relations between nature and artifact, experiencing architecture through drawing as a refined tool for architecture and town-planning. Reading the city and reading the landscape as a cooperating couple aiming at knowledge and creative actions.
