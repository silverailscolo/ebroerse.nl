Although this book, like the rest of the Tales of the City series, is relatively light and easy reading, it also manages to be deep and touching.
One becomes attached to the characters and wants to read on to see what becomes of them, gets mad at them for some of their choices and may even decide they are no longer friends. The occasional brush with "real" characters helps to add a bit of fun to the stories.
A must-read series, this look into the world of 70's and 80's San Francisco is heartwarming and addictive. Written in a way that lets you easily set the book down after each section/chapter (the books were originally created as short pieces that ran in newspapers) a strong caveat is in order: Be careful: you WILL end up reading well past your bedtime!
