You loved the comic strip; now read the business advice. 
 Or should that be anti-business advice?  Scott Adams provides the hapless victim of re-engineering, rightsizing and Total Quality Management some strategies for fighting  back, er, coping.  Forced to work long hours, with no hope of a raise?  Adams offers tips on maintaining parity in compensation.  Along the way, Adams explains what ISO 9000  really is and assesses the irresistibility of female engineers. 
 The breath-taking cynicism of the strip should prepare readers for the author's no-holds-barred attack on management fads, large organizations, pointless bureaucracy and sadistic rule-makers who glory in control of office supplies.  Readers of the on-line Dilbert Newsletter are familiar with the kind of e-mail Adams receives from his readers -- and may even have sent a few of those missives themselves.  Along with illustrative strips, e-mail messages provide excruciating examples of corporate behavior which compel the reader to agree with Adams when he insists that "People are idiots". 
 The final chapter offers a model for would-be successful businesses to follow:  the OA5 model.  It's introduced with little fanfare, no outrageous promises and just the right amount of self-deprecation.
