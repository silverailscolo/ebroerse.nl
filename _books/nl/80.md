- Useful for seasoned presenters as well as novices
- Offers inspiration and lots of fresh ideas - including presentation "templates"
- Practical, easy-to-follow advice  
  Powerpoint as a presentation tool has been overused and, increasingly, presenters are going back to basics to re-engage with their audience, and keep them interested. Charisma and knowledge are needed to win the day. This useful book from Eleri Sampson, a veteran presenter, provides ideas and templates suitable for any occasion. The first half concentrates on the skills necessary for a successful presentation such as adequate preparation, correct body language and keeping calm under pressure. The second half is crammed with original verbal, visual, and aural ideas for presentations that will make your audience wake up, sit up, and take notice.
