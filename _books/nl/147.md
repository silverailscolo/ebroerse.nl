If you're proficient at HTML, yet still fuzzy about Dynamic HTML, you're definitely not alone. Since the two browser heavyweights--Microsoft and Netscape--offer different flavors of DHTML, this promising technical advance for the Web is still in flux. "DHTML for the World Wide Web" is a no-nonsense look at where DHTML stands and how to use it effectively.
This Visual QuickStart guide delivers by offering a comprehensive look at using DHTML--in only 248 pages. The author wastes no time laying out the differences between the two vendors' approaches and establishing the common ground--mainly cascading style sheets (CSS) and JavaScript. With a fast-paced series of screen shots and step-by-step coding, you'll quickly learn the basics of CSS and how to use them effectively to control your typography and page layout. The book illustrates some of the most common uses of CSS--including multiple backgrounds, overlapping font styles, and columns without tables--clearly and quickly.
This guide also presents Document Object Models (DOM) to illustrate how to utilize dynamic event handling within your pages. Many popular techniques, such as moving banners, dragging objects, and creating pop-up menus, are included. An even balance of Netscape and Microsoft techniques makes this book a handy reference for any Web developer. "--Stephen Plain"
