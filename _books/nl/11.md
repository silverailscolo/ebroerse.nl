Nobody captures the heart and spirit of the steam powered locomotive, or the American Southwest like that of Robert Royem.  I wouldn't hesitate a comparison between his photography and the best works by Ansel Adams and  David Muench, in a word these images are sublime.  When you combine this  gift for photography with a style of prose that is both graceful and has  the abilty to turn a history lesson on the Durango & Silverton Narrow  Gauge Railroad into something as beautiful as a southwestern sunset and as  rich as the precious ore it's cars delivered, it is little wonder Royem is  being heralded as the best photojournalist in America today.  If your  interested in the captivating images and the historical significance that  the San Juan Mountains have to offer, or just interested in photos  documenting the painstaking craftsmanship that went into the making of this  countries early iron horses, then this is the book for you.  Hillerman,  Abbey, Woodkrutch move over and make way for a new kindred spirit, Robert  Royem, his photos speak of a couple centuries worth of words and his book  is an American classic that any reader will have a hard time putting down.
