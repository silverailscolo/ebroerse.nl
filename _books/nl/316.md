Since the beginning of the 90s, the number of single malt whiskys has tremendously increased. The pocket book is an excellent companion to the whisky amateur and will help you to select the whisky you want. Distillery details are limited to the essential, but contain enough details and are well written.
It is probably the most comprehensive, extensive and recent tasting book that you can get.
Please note that this book is a tasting guide and not on whisky's history!
