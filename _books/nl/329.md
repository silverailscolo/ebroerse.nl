From the roots of narrow-gauge steam in Wales to the modern steam-powered tourist trains of Pennsylvania, New Mexico and Colorado, this wonderful title features coal-consuming behemoths and the men and women who keep them chugging along tracks that measure just two or three feet in width. The historic equipment and procedures still used by these lines lend a timeless aura to photography that's sure to transport readers back to the days before diesel power.
