"Los Angeles: A Guide to Recent Architecture" is one in a series of lovely little guides to many of the world's major cities created by British publisher Ellipsis. The information contained here ranges from brief perspectives on the city's architectural history to tips on which maps are best for visitors and how to navigate the local public transit system. The book considers architecture not as something that happens on isolated building sites, but rather as social, cultural, and political phenomena. At four inches square, this highly portable book is an ideal travel companion.
Some of the other books in the series cover Chicago, Las Vegas, London, New York City, and Tokyo. Each guidebook has its own flavor, as different writers--usually architects--cover each city. "--Loren E. Baldwin"
