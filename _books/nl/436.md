With this book, the fourth, Sallie McFague brings her organic or ecological model to a practical conclusion.  Our care for nature should start with our look (loving) and continue with our touch.  She convincingly  argues for a change from a subject/object to a subject/subjects mindset.   This is not an apocalyptic doomsayer oracle but a hands-on advice on how we  should love nature.  There is hope for the future but it will take work.   This is an excellent book, worthy of your time but be warned - you will  want to go out and dirty your hands with the earth's soil.
