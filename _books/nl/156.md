Let me first say that this is a great introductory work and I think very highly of it. However, this collection's title is sort of a misnomer.  It should really be called "Introducton" or "excerpts from Pre-Norman English Writings".  To think of all of the work as poetry is sort of strange since nearly all writing from the area in the time period was written in a metered fashion.  Regardless of this, the book provides great insight into the Anglo-Saxon literature of pre-Norman times including pieces of the works of Bede.  It seems that there is actually more notes and explanation than is there source material (actual writing from the time period)and this is very useful in reading this book and will help in understanding other writings of the period as well. We are seldom exposed to this sort of writing in our schooling so a little explanation is key to gathering any sort of understanding of the people that wrote it.  To dive right into the source material without some background would be meaningless.

The finest (and longest) piece of writing in the book is "The Battle of Maldon" which describes a Viking raid on an English coastal village.  It is spectacular and gripping writing and to our sensationalist minds this work is well within our comfort level with plenty of violence and horror. Again the notes to this piece are great.

I recommend this book to anyone who wants some to learn more about early medieval writing and pre Norman England.  It is not the world easiest stuff but it isn't that difficult either.  This book is great because it is so difficult to come across works of this era is actually quite difficult. If you like this book check out Bede's "Ecclesiastical History of England" it's a little more difficult but again very rewarding.
