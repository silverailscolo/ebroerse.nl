Architecture and public spaces are accepted components of the urban realm - but what about technical infrastructure? Although the interdependence between infrastructure and urban development has been a central topic in urban planning, infrastructure as a design element plays a comparatively subordinate role./n /n This volume discusses spatial design implications of technical and transport infrastructure. The authors look at projects of various scales - from skate parks to urban highways - in many different cities - Mexico City, New York, London, Paris, Zurich, Seattle, Barcelona, Stockholm, Sao Paulo, Antwerp. They demonstrate that infrastructure generates its own category of urban realm.
