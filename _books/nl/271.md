Unless your species evolved sometime after 1993 when  "Jurassic Park" hit theaters, you're no doubt familiar with this  dinosaur-bites-man disaster tale set on an island theme park gone  terribly wrong. But if Speilberg's amped-up CGI creation left you  longing for more scientific background and ... well, character  development, check out the original Michael Crichton novel. Although  not his best book (get ahold of sci-fi classic "The Andromeda Strain"  for that), "Jurassic Park" fills out the film version's kinetic  story line with additional scenes, dialogue, and explanations while  still maintaining Crichton's trademark thrills-'n'-chills pacing. As  ever, the book really is better than the movie. "--Paul Hughes"
