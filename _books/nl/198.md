This is how it all started for Douglas Coupland. The story of Andy, Dag and Claire, three Generation-X-twentysomethings. Sharing an inside look into their everyday life with the reader, garnished with tasteful little stories from their past life, spot-hitting illustrations and guidelines such as "bench-press your i.q." make this one an absolute must-read for everybody born after 1968 and a bible for parents to understand the real problems of their little ones.BUY THIS, NO MORE WORDS NECESSARY!!!
