Even the most elaborate Celtic pattern boils down to a few basic motifs (including spirals, swastikas, circles, "s" curves, knots, tau crosses, sun signs, etc.). This lavishly illustrated handbook of over 600 designs offers a key to the intricacies of Celtic decoration, showing how the judicious use of these simple symbols, motifs, or ideographs can be used to develop newer and more ambitious patterns to meet the requirements of modern decorative art. Over 600 b/w illus.
