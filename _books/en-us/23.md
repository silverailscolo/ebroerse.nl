This is an excellent book. I read it in the early 1970's and it has to be a classic as it has stuck with me all this time. By suggesting that the mechanical and electrical apparatus of our modern dwellings is more  important than decorative appearance it puts forward the seminal concepts  that have driven the architecture of Sirs Norman Foster and Richard Rogers,  and today's High-Tech Movement in architecture.
