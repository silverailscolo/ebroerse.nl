Before Martin Brennan and his team researched the Boyne Valley cairns and Knowth, few archeologists took the locals seriously when they told stories of the structures. Even after the studies were complete many archeologists  wouldn't comment on what the team found. Now, years later, there is a  grudging admittance that Brennan's astronishing work is correct. The  concepts and the illustrations will take your breath away. Prepare to be  astounded.
