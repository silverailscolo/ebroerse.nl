The Business Benefits of GIS: An ROI Approach presents a fact-based, benefits-focused methodology aimed at ensuring the sustainability of GIS initiatives by effectively demonstrating the success of the investment. Unlike other return-on-investment (ROI) books, the methodology addressed in The Business Benefits of GIS is based on an established framework and was adapted by ESRI, in collaboration with PA Consulting Group, to combine ESRI GIS expertise with PA Consulting Group's professional management experience. The result is a step-by-step framework with supplemental case studies, interactive digital tools, and templates that allow the reader to apply the book's methodology to GIS initiatives and achieve consensus among stakeholders.
