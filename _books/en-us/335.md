My mother bought this book in 1970 and it is a precious family treasurer. Our library board which is in the process of fund-raising for a new library is considering this book as a drawing card for donations for a give-away.  It is one which board members said they would love to own. Mother's large  heavy book has several large prints that can be framed. It's a heartwarming  book which emphasizes the truth that a picture can say a thousand words.
