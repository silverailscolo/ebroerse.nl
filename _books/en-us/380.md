The 20 units present the most important words and expressions you are likely to need, and provide a "survival" vocabulary together with the basic language patterns which you can adapt to any situation in which you find yourself. Throughout the book, a transliteration system gives a pronunciation guide for every word and phrase. Practice sections, with answers, help build up your confidence in using the language and encourage you to construct your own phrases, rather than rely on a phrasebook. A brief explanation of essential grammar, two-day vocabulary lists and useful background information sections are also included.
