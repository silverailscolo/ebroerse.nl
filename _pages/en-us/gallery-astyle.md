Looking at cars, I always try to categorise the designer's solution to connect the front
fender, the windshield and the side window, what's known as the A-post.

To group different manufacturer's solutions for this part of their cars, I drew up this diagram:

<figure><img src='{{ "/assets/img-noresample/astyle/20200520221733-aab98954-1037x1200.jpg" | relative_url }}' alt='Typology of car A-posts' class='img-fluid' >
<figcaption class="kleiner">Typology of car A-posts (<a prefix="dct: https://purl.org/dc/terms/" href="https://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Image" property="dct:title" rel="dct:type">still image</a> &copy;<a prefix="cc: https://creativecommons.org/ns#" href="https://www.ebroerse.nl" property="cc:attributionName" rel="cc:attributionURL">EJB</a> under <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">CC BY-NC-SA</a>)</figcaption></figure>

And here are some cars I spotted and shot outside.
