The location in Rockport had been part of my layout design since more than five years, but the detailed drawings I had studied over and over for the last 40 years contained so much detail that this clearly was not a beginner’s model.</p> <p><img src="/ebroerse.nl/assets/img/blog/IMG_4144.jpg" alt="Tacome power house">]</p> <div class="caption"> A look from the aisle, with Tacoma Power House in the back. </div> <p><img src="/ebroerse.nl/assets/img/blog/IMG_4129.jpg" alt="lumber shed model">]</p> <div class="caption"> The well stocked interior of the lumber shed. </div> <p>Windows are Grandt Line castings, some adapted by splitting and joining. All doors were hand made from styrene or stripwood.
